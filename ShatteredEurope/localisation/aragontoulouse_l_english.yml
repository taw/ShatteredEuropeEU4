 pog_aratou_event_1_title: "Albigenesian Crusade ignored!"
 pog_aratou_event_1_desc: "The Pope's call for crusade against the heretics in Toulouse was ignored, and the holdings of some Aragonese nobility are secure for a while longer. However, Toulouse is in a precarious position, and the holdings of our nobility there may later be endangered by France. We could align ourselves with the followers of this new faith, or we could seek to take their land as our own while they are hated in the eyes of our fellow Catholics of Europe."
 pog_aratou_event_1_opt_1: "We will secure our position in the Mediterranian. Toulouse will be ours!"
 pog_aratou_event_1_opt_2: "The Cathars would make valuable friends."

 pog_aratou_event_2_desc: "[ARA.Monarch.GetTitle] [ARA.Monarch.GetName] has offered us an alliance. Few are in such a position to help us in our cause as Aragon, and with their help, we could defend ourselves from Catholics who would seek to destroy us."
 pog_aratou_event_2_opt_1: "Of course we'll accept!"
 pog_aratou_event_2_opt_2: "Toulouse stands alone."
 pog_aratou_event_3_name: "The Heresy and the King"

 pog_aratou_event_3_opt_1: "He simply stayed home."
 pog_aratou_event_3_opt_2: "It's true, he's a Cathar now!"
