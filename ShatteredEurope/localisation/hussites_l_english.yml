 flavor_hussites_1_title: "Clergy worries about translations of Wycliffe"
 flavor_hussites_1_desc: "Czech translations of the theological tract 'Trialogus' by English philosopher John Wycliffe are spreading throughout Bohemia, thanks to a prominent priest named Jan Hus. However, the mainstream clergy views the piece as heretical, as Wycliffe advocates the doctrine of Impanation - that neither the body of Christ nor the bread is altered in the Eucharist. They are pressuring us to actively censor its publication."
 flavor_hussites_1_a: "Censor the heretic."
 flavor_hussites_1_b: "Let this priest publish what he wants."

 flavor_hussites_2_desc: "Two Bohemian students have brought a document bearing the seal of the University of Oxford to Prague, which praises John Wycliffe, and also Jan Hus for his efforts in translating Wycliffe's works into Czech. Hus has been triumphantly reading out the document from his pulpit, and out in the streets."
 flavor_hussites_2_a: "Interesting."
 flavor_hussites_3_title: "Jan Hus spreading heresies in Bohemia"
 flavor_hussites_3_desc: "The priest Jan Hus is becoming more outspoken in his criticisms of the Pope and the Catholic Church. His talk of reforms and direct opposition to the crusades is stirring up resentment for the church in the Czech people."
 flavor_hussites_3_a: "Arrest him at once!"
 flavor_hussites_3_b: "Let him speak freely."

 allowed_hus: "Allowed Jan Hus to speak freely"
 flavor_hussites_4_title: "Hussites protest Jan Hus' arrest"
 flavor_hussites_4_desc: "As the trial of Jan Hus continues the evidence begins to mount of his heresy. 39 charges have been leveled against him describing his opposition to Catholic doctrine and the Holy Roman Empire. Hus has refused to recant and is demanding that proof of his guilt be found within the text of the Bible. Meanwhile his followers have gained considerable influence despite his arrest and are demanding his immediate release. Their threats of open rebellion should not be taken lightly."
 flavor_hussites_4_a: "Burn him at the stake."
 flavor_hussites_4_b: "Pardon him and officially apologize."

 flavor_hussites_5_title: "Neighbours offer aid against Hussite threat"
 flavor_hussites_5_desc: "Some of our neighbours, most notably Hungary, have become increasingly concerned by the perceived religious instability within our borders, and fear it may spread further. They have offered gold and men to help us maintain order. However, resorting to foreign aid will most likely undermine our subjects' faith in the legitimacy of the government."
 flavor_hussites_5_a: "We need all the help we can get."
 flavor_hussites_5_b: "Thanks but no thanks."
 flavor_hussites_6_title: "Defenestration of Prague"
 flavor_hussites_6_desc: "In their boldest protest yet, the followers of Jan Hus have marched on the town hall of our capital in response to the foreign intervention in Bohemia's affairs.

 flavor_hussites_8_a: "War is upon us!" 
 flavor_hussites_9_title: "Jan Hus back to preaching"
 flavor_hussites_9_desc: "Now that we have pardoned Jan Hus, he and his followers have taken this as having carte blanche to preach their interpretation of Christianity freely. Accordingly, they have largely stopped their attacks on the Bohemian government and are directing their propaganda against the Church in Rome and the structure of the clergy. While far from ideal from a foreign relations standpoint, this does leave us some breathing room for keeping the peace."
 flavor_hussites_9_a: "We may have just avoided a civil war ..."
 flavor_hussites_10_title: "Hussites demand further reforms."
 flavor_hussites_10_desc: "Jan Hus and his growing number of followers are spreading increasingly strong-worded attacks on the Catholic Church. The Pope has taken a very personal interest in the events within our nation now and is demanding we proclaim where our loyalties lie. There is no doubt about it: conflict is in our nation's future. The only question is who are we going to support?"
 flavor_hussites_10_a: "The line has to be drawn here: this far, no further!"

 flavor_hussites_13_title: "Hussites promote dialogue on reform."
 flavor_hussites_13_desc: "Our ecumenical approach to the dispute between Hussites and Catholics has staved off armed rebellion, but it has also led to populist talks opposing the Church, the Holy Roman Empire and even our own monarchy. The reforms the Czech people are demanding include the separation from the Catholic church and abolition of the monarchy. Some sort of compromise seems unavoidable but either way our reputation among the Catholics will be forever tarnished."
 flavor_hussites_13_a: "Agree to a compromise."

 flavor_hussites_15_title: "Hussite factions splinter!"
 flavor_hussites_15_desc: "While united during the religious tumults that recently plagued our nation, the numerous factions within the Hussite movement have begun to splinter. The most radical, the Taborites, advocate the complete abolition of the monarchy in favor of a communal Theocracy. The more moderate Orebites support our religious independence but otherwise want to preserve the political status quo. The Utraquists have only a few minor issues with existing doctrine and seek to reestablish close ties with the Catholics."

 flavor_hussites_19_desc: "Our open minded approach to opposing theology in our nation has averted civil war.

His outspoken criticism of our state is straining our relations with our neighbors and making life for our cardinals in Rome very difficult."
 flavor_hussites_19_a: "History will vindicate us."
